</button>
```

</Button>
```

## 🚀 API Endpoints

### **GET /api/guestbook**

  "signatures": [
    {
      "id": "1697123456789",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "image": "data:image/png;base64,...",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-11T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **POST /api/guestbook**
**Purpose:** Save new signature  
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "id": "1697123456789",
  "name": "John Doe",

  "timestamp": "2025-10-11T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Response:** Full updated signatures list

---

## 🔒 Data Management

**Storage Location:**
```
frontend/public/guestbook-signatures.json
```

**Max Signatures:** 100 (automatically trims oldest)

**Fallback:** localStorage for client-side persistence if API fails

**Format:** PNG images as base64 strings

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

**Desktop:**
- 3-column grid for signature wall

- 2-column grid
- Same canvas size
- Responsive modal

**Mobile:**

- Full-screen modal
- Touch drawing supported

---

## 🎯 User Experience

**Animations:**
- Fade in/out for modal (0.3s)
- Stagger effect for signature grid (50ms delay per item)
- Scale animations on buttons
- Smooth transitions

**Feedback:**
- "Saving..." loading state
- Success: Signature appears immediately
- Error: Falls back to localStorage
- Clear/Cancel options available

**Accessibility:**
- Keyboard navigable (ESC to close modal)
- High contrast in dark mode
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Clear visual feedback

---

## 🐛 Edge Cases Handled

1. **API Failure** → Falls back to localStorage
2. **Empty Name** → Alert prompts user
3. **File Doesn't Exist** → Auto-creates on first use
4. **Too Many Signatures** → Auto-trims to 100
5. **Canvas Not Supported** → N/A (required for feature)
6. **Network Issues** → localStorage persists locally

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Drawing Canvas:**
```javascript
// Mouse & Touch Events
onMouseDown={startDrawing}
onMouseMove={draw}
onMouseUp={stopDrawing}
onTouchStart={startDrawing}
onTouchMove={draw}
onTouchEnd={stopDrawing}
```

### **Data Persistence:**
```javascript
// Try API first
const response = await fetch('/api/guestbook', { ... });

// Fallback to localStorage
if (!response.ok) {
  localStorage.setItem('guestbook_signatures', JSON.stringify(data));
}
```

### **Image Conversion:**
```javascript
const imageData = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
// Returns: "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS..."
```

---

## 📊 Bundle Impact

**Before:** 226 kB  
**After:** 227 kB (+1 kB)

**Minimal impact due to:**
- Canvas is native HTML5 (no library)
- Uses existing Framer Motion
- Reuses existing Button/Card components
- API route is server-side only

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### **Why Canvas Instead of SVG?**
- More natural drawing experience
- Better touch support
- Simpler implementation
- Lower overhead for signatures

### **Why Local Storage Fallback?**
- Resilience against network issues
- Works even if API is down
- Better offline experience
- Progressive enhancement

### **Why Max 100 Signatures?**
- Prevents file bloat
- Keeps page load fast
- Encourages quality over quantity
- Easy to increase if needed

### **Why Blue Color?**
- Matches site's primary color
- High contrast on white background
- Professional look
- Consistent with brand
