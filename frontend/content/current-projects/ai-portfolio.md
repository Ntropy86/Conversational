# AI-Powered Interactive Portfolio
## Next.js + FastAPI + Qwen-7B â€¢ Voice-enabled AI assistant

### Project Overview
Building this very website! This project represents the intersection of my full-stack development and ML engineering skills, creating a conversational AI assistant that can answer questions about my experience, projects, and skills using RAG-lite architecture.

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion
- **Backend:** FastAPI with streaming response capabilities  
- **AI Model:** Qwen-7B for conversational responses
- **Voice Processing:** Real-time voice activity detection (VAD)
- **Data Pipeline:** RAG-lite with document grounding and guardrails

### Key Features
