# Data Scientist / Data Engineer
**Dataplatr Consulting** • Sep 2024 – Present • Remote (USA)

## Role Overview
Leading data engineering initiatives at Dataplatr Consulting, focusing on LLM-driven automation and SQL optimization. Built production systems that reduced manual SQL writing time by 60% while handling 1M+ row schemas.

## Key Achievements

### LLM-Driven Code Generation Tool
- **Problem**: Engineers spent 8-10 hours writing SQL per table
- **Solution**: Built Databricks + GPT-4 integration for automated SQL generation
- **Result**: Reduced review time to 3-4 hours (60% time saved) on 1M+ row schemas
- **Impact**: Enabled team to handle 3× more data processing requests

### Token Optimization & Batch Processing
- **Problem**: Wide tables caused token-limit failures in LLM prompts
- **Solution**: Developed intelligent batch-chunking routine
- **Result**: Cut prompt runtime by 40-50% while maintaining accuracy
- **Technical**: Implemented dynamic chunking based on table width and complexity

### Team Collaboration & Mentoring
- **BI Team Partnership**: Collaborated on edge-case handling and user experience
- **Human-in-Loop UI**: Built interface for manual review and correction workflows
- **Intern Mentoring**: Guided 1 intern on data engineering best practices
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Documented processes and created training materials
