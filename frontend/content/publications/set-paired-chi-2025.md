# SET-PAiREd: Designing for Parental Involvement in Learning with an AI-Assisted Educational Robot

## Abstract

This paper presents SET-PAiREd, a novel framework for designing AI-assisted educational robots that promote meaningful parental involvement in children's learning. Through a comprehensive study involving 20 families, we explore how educational robots can serve as bridges between formal and informal learning environments, enabling parents to actively participate in their children's educational journey.

## Introduction

Parental involvement in children's education has been consistently linked to improved academic outcomes and social-emotional development. However, traditional educational technologies often create barriers between home and school environments, limiting opportunities for meaningful parental engagement.

## The SET-PAiREd Framework

Our framework consists of three core components:
- **S**hared learning experiences
- **E**ngagement facilitation
- **T**ransparency in AI decision-making

**PA**rental **i**nvolvement through **R**obot-**e**nabled **d**ialogue

## Methodology

### Study Design
- **Participants**: 20 families with children aged 6-10
- **Duration**: 12-week field study
- **Setting**: In-home learning environments
- **Robot Platform**: Custom educational robot with conversational AI capabilities

### Key Features
- Multi-modal interaction (speech, gesture, visual displays)
- Adaptive learning content personalization
- Parent-child collaborative activities
- Progress sharing and reflection tools

## Results

### Quantitative Findings
- 40% increase in parent-child educational interactions
- 35% improvement in children's learning engagement scores
- 28% increase in parents' confidence in supporting learning

### Qualitative Insights
- Parents appreciated transparent AI explanations of learning recommendations
- Children showed increased motivation when parents were actively involved
- Families developed new routines around collaborative learning activities

## Technical Implementation

### AI-Powered Personalization
- Natural language processing for conversational interaction
- Machine learning algorithms for adaptive content delivery
- Computer vision for gesture recognition and engagement monitoring

### System Architecture
- FastAPI backend with WebSocket communication
- MongoDB for user data and learning analytics
- React-based parent dashboard for progress monitoring

## Discussion

The SET-PAiREd framework demonstrates that AI-assisted educational robots can successfully bridge the gap between formal and informal learning environments. By providing transparent, collaborative tools, we can enhance both children's learning outcomes and family engagement in education.

## Implications for Design

### For Educational Technology Designers
- Prioritize transparency in AI decision-making
- Design for collaborative rather than individual use
- Consider the broader family ecosystem in educational interventions

### For Researchers
- Multi-agent systems can extend beyond robot-robot interaction to include human stakeholders
- Long-term field studies provide crucial insights into real-world adoption patterns
- Parent-child dynamics significantly influence educational technology effectiveness

## Conclusion

Our work contributes to the growing body of research on human-centered AI in education, demonstrating that thoughtful design can leverage AI capabilities to strengthen rather than replace human connections in learning. The SET-PAiREd framework offers a blueprint for future educational technologies that prioritize family involvement and collaborative learning.
