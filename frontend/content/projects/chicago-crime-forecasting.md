# Chicago Crime Data Forecasting & Hotspot Analysis
**Feb 2025**

## Project Overview
Engineered a hybrid ARIMA-LSTM predictive model that improved crime pattern forecasting accuracy to 85%, enabling law enforcement to optimize patrol resource allocation through advanced data science techniques.

## Problem Statement
Chicago faces significant challenges in crime prevention and resource allocation. Traditional approaches lack predictive capabilities, resulting in reactive rather than proactive policing strategies. This project aimed to develop a data-driven solution for crime forecasting and hotspot identification.

## Technical Approach

### Data Engineering
- **Dataset**: Analyzed 2M+ crime records from Chicago Police Department (2015-2024)
- **Processing**: Implemented distributed data processing using PySpark on AWS EMR
- **Cleaning**: Developed robust data cleaning pipeline handling missing values and outliers
- **Feature Engineering**: Created temporal, spatial, and categorical features for model training

### Predictive Modeling
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combined ARIMA for trend analysis with LSTM for pattern recognition
- **ARIMA Component**: Captured seasonal trends and cyclical patterns in crime data
- **LSTM Component**: Learned complex temporal dependencies and non-linear relationships
- **Ensemble Method**: Weighted combination of models optimized through cross-validation

### Geospatial Analysis
- **Clustering**: Applied DBSCAN algorithm for dynamic crime hotspot identification
- **Spatial Features**: Integrated demographic, economic, and geographic variables
- **Visualization**: Created interactive heatmaps and temporal analysis dashboards

## Key Achievements
- **Accuracy**: Achieved 85% forecasting accuracy (15% improvement over baseline)
- **Performance**: Reduced computational time by 40% through distributed processing
- **Scalability**: System handles real-time updates with sub-minute latency
- **Impact**: Enabled 20% more efficient patrol resource allocation

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: ARIMA, LSTM, DBSCAN
- **Big Data**: PySpark, AWS EMR, AWS S3
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial queries
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Plotly, Folium
