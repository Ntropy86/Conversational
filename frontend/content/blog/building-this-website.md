# Building This Website: From Figma to Production

**Published:** January 15, 2025  
**Reading Time:** 15 minutes

## Introduction

This portfolio website represents a comprehensive journey from initial design concepts to a fully deployed production application with AI-powered features. Here's how it all came together.

## Design Phase

### Initial Wireframes in Figma

Started with Figma to design:
- Clean, modern interface
- Dark mode support
- Responsive layouts for mobile and desktop
- Interactive elements and animations

### Component System

Built a reusable component library:
- **Cards**: Consistent styling for experiences, projects, publications
- **Buttons**: Multiple variants (primary, secondary, outline)
- **Chips**: Technology tags with auto-coloring
- **Typography**: Standardized text styles

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations

**Key Features:**
- Server-side rendering for SEO
- Dynamic content loading
- Tabbed navigation system
- Smooth page transitions

### Backend Services

**AI Integration:**
- FastAPI backend for conversational AI
- Groq API for LLM responses
- Whisper for speech-to-text
- Real-time voice processing

## Content Management

### Dynamic Content System

Content is managed through JSON files:
- `resume_data.json`: Master data source
- `content-metadata.json`: Frontend metadata
- Markdown files for detailed content

This approach provides:
- Easy content updates
- No database required
- Version control friendly
- Fast loading times

## Performance Optimization

### Key Optimizations

1. **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for heavy components
2. **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
3. **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with WebP
4. **Caching**: Strategic use of browser caching

### Results

- First Contentful Paint: <1s
- Time to Interactive: <2s
- Lighthouse Score: 90+

## AI Features

### Hybrid Search System

Built a sophisticated query system:
- Keyword extraction from user questions
- Semantic matching against resume data
- Dynamic card selection
- Conversation memory

### Voice Interface

Implemented real-time voice interaction:
- Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
- Streaming audio responses
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Safari-specific optimizations

## Deployment

### Infrastructure

**Frontend:**
- Deployed on Vercel
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Edge functions for API routes
- Global CDN distribution

**Backend:**
- Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces
- Docker containerization
- GPU acceleration for ML models
- Health monitoring

## Challenges Overcome

### 1. Voice Processing

**Challenge**: Browser compatibility for voice recording  
**Solution**: Built custom VAD implementations for different browsers

### 2. State Management

**Challenge**: Complex tab system with dynamic content  
**Solution**: React Context for global state, local state for components

### 3. Performance

**Challenge**: Heavy ML models affecting load times  
**Solution**: Lazy loading, code splitting, and service worker caching

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

1. **Component-First Design**: Building reusable components saved significant time
2. **TypeScript**: Caught many bugs during development
3. **Incremental Development**: Starting simple and adding features iteratively

### What I'd Do Differently

1. **Earlier Testing**: More cross-browser testing from the start
2. **Performance Budget**: Set performance budgets earlier
3. **Documentation**: Document decisions as they're made

## Technical Stack Summary

### Frontend
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- TypeScript

### Backend
- FastAPI
- Groq (LLM)
- Whisper (ASR)
- ElevenLabs (TTS)
- Docker

### Deployment
- Vercel (Frontend)
- Hugging Face Spaces (Backend)
- GitHub (Version Control)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track user interactions
2. **Blog System**: Share technical insights
3. **Project Demos**: Interactive project showcases
4. **Testimonials**: Client/colleague feedback section

### Technical Improvements

1. **Offline Support**: Service worker for offline functionality
2. **PWA Features**: Install prompt, push notifications
3. **Advanced Caching**: Smarter cache invalidation
4. **A/B Testing**: Test different UI variations

## Conclusion

Building this website was an incredible learning experience that combined design, development, and AI integration. The result is a portfolio that not only showcases my work but also demonstrates modern web development practices and innovative AI features.

The key to success was maintaining focus on user experience while building robust, scalable infrastructure. Starting with a clear vision, iterating quickly, and always keeping performance in mind made all the difference.
