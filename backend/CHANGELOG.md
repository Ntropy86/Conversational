## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 Release Notes

This is the initial stable release of the Conversational AI Backend. The system provides a complete voice-to-voice conversational experience with intelligent content selection and structured responses.

**Key Highlights:**
- Production-ready FastAPI backend
- Complete audio processing pipeline
- Intelligent resume content querying
- Automatic file management
- Comprehensive documentation
- Docker deployment support

**System Requirements:**
- Python 3.9+
- FFmpeg for audio processing
- 4GB+ RAM recommended
- SSD storage for optimal performance

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure environment: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Groq API key
4. Start server: `python api_server.py`
5. Access API at `http://localhost:8000`

**Breaking Changes:**
None - this is the initial release.

**Migration Guide:**
Not applicable for initial release.

**Known Issues:**
- Large audio files (>25MB) may cause timeout issues
- Some edge cases in VAD may cause early speech cutoff
- Memory usage can increase with long-running sessions

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Average response time: 2-4 seconds
- Concurrent request support: 10-20 requests
- Memory usage: 200-500MB typical
- Audio processing latency: 1.5-3.5 seconds

**Security Notes:**
- API keys should be stored securely in environment variables
- Audio files are automatically cleaned up for privacy
- No persistent storage of conversation data by default
- CORS is configurable for production deployment
