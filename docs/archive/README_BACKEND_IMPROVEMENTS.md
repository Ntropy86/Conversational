## üéâ Final Thoughts

The backend is **functional but needs work** to be production-ready. The good news is:
- ‚úÖ You have a working foundation
- ‚úÖ The architecture is fixable
- ‚úÖ The improvements are well-documented
- ‚úÖ The path forward is clear

With 8-10 weeks of focused work, you can transform this from a proof-of-concept to a production-grade system that can scale to thousands of users.

**Good luck! üöÄ**
